  # A disk image rather than the zip that Sparkle uses. Homebrew extracts a
  # zip with `unzip`, which writes AppleDouble sidecar files inside
  # Sparkle.framework; those aren't covered by the signature, so the seal
  # breaks and Gatekeeper refuses to launch what it just installed. DMGs are
  # extracted with `ditto`, which handles them correctly.

  # Panewright generates the aerospace and sketchybar configs, so uninstalling
  # should offer to take them back out. Its own config, saved profiles and the
  # backups of whatever it replaced are left alone deliberately — those are
  # the user's, and a `zap` that deletes someone's saved layouts because they
  # ran `brew uninstall` would be indefensible.

    <<~EOS
      Panewright needs Accessibility and Input Monitoring permissions.
      It asks for them on first launch — they can't be granted ahead of time.

      Your existing aerospace and sketchybar configs are copied to
      ~/.config/panewright/backups/ before Panewright writes its own.
